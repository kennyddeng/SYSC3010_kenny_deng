# SYSC3010_kenny_deng
Repository for sysc3010A taken during W2022. Contains separate folders for each lab. Each lab focuses on a different topic. <br>

<h2> IMPORTANT - READ THIS! </h2>
If you are reviewing my commits please browse the "old" branch. I was dumb and forced a commit on main (long story, I had issues with the current branch being ahead). 
Anyways I was able to restore to a previous commit and thus restoring my commit history. I kept the old commit history on a new branch ("old"). <br>

<h2> Short Description of Each Lab Folder </h2>
<a href="./Lab1/">Lab1</a>: Setting up your Rpi, GitHub, SenseHAT, Python programming on RPi <br>
